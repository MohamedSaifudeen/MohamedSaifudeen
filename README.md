# Mohamed Saifudeen

I'm currently learning and building skills in cybersecurity with a focus on practical, hands-on experience.

My work includes:

- Active learning on **TryHackMe** (SOC Level 1, offensive labs)
- Writing **walkthroughs** for completed rooms
- Exploring web application vulnerabilities

This GitHub contains personal projects, scripts, writeups, and learning material.
